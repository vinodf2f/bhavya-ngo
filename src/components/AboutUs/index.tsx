      <p>
      We started this NGO on Vishal and Swapnaja's daughter's birthday. 
      The NGO is named after their daughter, Bhavya. Vishal is a software engineer, 
      Swapnaja has completed her education up to BCS, and Vishakha is a doctor with qualifications in M.B.B.S. 
      and DGO. Additionally, Vishvanath is a retired teacher and the vice-president (upsarpanch in Marathi) of Kolnur 
      village. Vinod and Suraj are software engineers, and Sneha is currently pursuing her B.Tech in computer science.
      We also have Rajkumar, who is a farmer. 
      Initially, our goal was to encourage underprivileged children to pursue education by providing them with school kits. 
      However, we aspire to achieve much more than that.
